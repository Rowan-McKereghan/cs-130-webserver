It doesn\u0027t have to be with unit tests, but a simple python/bash (or even JS?) script should do. you don\u0027t have to do it since you\u0027ve already written so much, but please at least make a file and add a comment so i can add it to the assignment tracker.",

The code is basically identical to before except now it structures things with JSON.\n\nThe sum of the logic in this function is \"if the JSON has two keys, call a function with them, otherwise if it has a 3rd key, use that key\"",

I don\u0027t think there\u0027s much to test here that isn\u0027t inherently tied to so many browser things.\n\nE.g., testing CSS generally requires a whole UI test framework, and it\u0027s very difficult to test say whether the dom was updated properly. I think this is clearly out of scope here.",
